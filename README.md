# Bug Vibes

A cosmic coding defense game where you protect your precious code from invading bugs!

## Game Description

In Bug Vibes, you control Intergalactic Igor, a heroic code defender who must keep pesky bugs from infiltrating your codebase. The goal is to bounce the bugs away before they touch the ground and corrupt your code.

- Use the **left and right arrow keys** or **A and D keys** to move Igor
- Hit the bugs with Igor's head to keep them from touching your code (the ground)
- Each successfully deflected bug earns you a point
- The game ends when a bug touches the ground, corrupting your perfect code

## Features

## Inspiration

Bug Vibes takes inspiration from the ball bouncing mini-game featured in International Karate+ (IK+), a fighting game developed by System 3 and published in 1987. The original mini-game has been reimagined with a cosmic code defense theme featuring Intergalactic Igor as the protagonist.

## Technical Details

This game is built using:
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic
